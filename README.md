# MountMonitor
MountMonitor is an Arduino based monitoring device for a German Equatorial Mount (GEM) used for astrophotography.

The device is attached to the counterweight bar of the GEM, and uses a 3-axis accelerometer to monitor the position of the bar.

It is calibrated with a momentary action switch, and controls relays to indicate when the RA axis is in the home position, and when the mount is at the meridian limit.
